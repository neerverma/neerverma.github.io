            <p>An academic research project, where we are creating neighborhood guides from publically available geotagged data and social media data. The primary researcher for the project is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/dan-tasse">Dan Tasse</a>, a PHD student at Carnegie Mellon University. As the designer on the team (advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/jason-hong">Professor Jason Hong</a>), my role was to reimagine the UX and UI for the neighborhood guides . </p>

            <p class = "subheading"> Understanding what travellers wants to know about a neighbourhood by conducting user research.

            </p>
            <div class="space5px"></div>

            <p>We started with deploying a survey involving 500+ participants and  then conducted 17 user interviews. The key questions we were interested in were:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li>What are the most important factors people consider when they choose a place to stay when they are travelling?</li>
                <li>What do people wish travelers and movers knew about their neighborhood?</li>
                <li>What are the different places where people share their opinions and experiences of their travel?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="space5px"></div>

            <p>Our results suggested the following six factors people were most interested into. We also figured out the relevant geotagged publicly available sources to gather information about these factors.

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>Design Challenges</h3>
         <p>
            After identifying the key factors and data sources, here comes the design challenges:

         </p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li>How can we make sure that nieghborhood guide is easy to understand?</li>
                <li>How can we enable the travellers to get to the neighborhoods they are interested in?</li>
                <li>How can we enable the travellers to choose between different neighborhoods?</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <div class='sec4'>

            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>Iterations</h3>
            <p> I was quickly moving between paper and digital prototyping, testing prototypes with users. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.
            </p>
            <h2>Initial iterations were focused on creating a information dashboard</h2>
