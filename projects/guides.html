                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Traditional and Online guidebooks give people information about those central tourist districts and sights to see. Yelp and Foursquare give people information about the businesses, the bars and restaurants and locksmiths, in an area, but travelers cannot easily understand how the whole neighborhood feels just from that. In order to design tourist guides of the future to help people renting through the sharing economy we developed neighborhood guides from publically available geotagged data and social media data. </p>

            <h3 id='s1' class='section'>Background</h3>
            <p>An academic research project, where we are creating neighborhood guides from publically available geotagged data and social media data. The primary researcher for the project is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/dan-tasse">Dan Tasse</a>, a PHD student at Carnegie Mellon University. As the designer on the team (advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/jason-hong">Professor Jason Hong</a>), my role was to reimagine the UX and UI for the neighborhood guides . </p>

            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>What Travellers want</h3>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p> We started with research, which involved a survey involving 500+ participants and interviewing 17 creative tourists. The key questions we were interested in were:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li>What are the most important factors people consider when they choose a place to stay when they are travelling?</li>
                <li>What do people wish travelers and movers knew about their neighborhood?</li>
                <li>What are the different places where people share their opinions and experiences of their travel?</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Based on the results of our research, we identified 6 key factors and data sources for these factors:
            </p>

                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/guides/research.png" alt="Paper Prototype">

            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>Design Challenges</h3>
            <p>Even though we have identified the key factors and data sources, here comes the design challenges:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li>How can we make sure that nieghborhood guide is easy to understand?</li>
                <li>How can we enable the travellers to get to the neighborhoods they might be interested in?</li>
                <li>How can we enable the travellers to choose between different neighborhoods?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
            </div>
            <div class="clear-design"></div>
            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>Iterations</h3>
            <p> I was quickly moving between paper and digital prototyping, testing prototypes with users. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.
            </p>

            <p>Since this was an independent study, I was managing my own workflow and deadlines. I was proactive throughout entire project, communicating with the team, collecting feedback and iterating on my design solutions. The insights from the team, developers, and feedback from the users were invaluable for the project and brought me closer to acheiving the project goals.
